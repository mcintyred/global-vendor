<h1>Global Vendor Code Discussion</h1>

<p>
The list of modules which make up this project is:
<pre>
   gv-parent/
      gv-api/
      gv-core/
      gv-warehouse-gemfire/
      gv-warehouse-jpa/
      gv-warehouse-node/
      gv-web/
      gv-web-standalone/
</pre>
</p>

<h2>gv-api</h2>
This project defines the service interfaces used by the other projects. It also defines the message formats used by the SOAP Gateway and Spring Batch for file processing.
The main packages in this project are as follows:

<table><tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>gv.api</td><td>Contains the model objects (DTOs) Warehouse, Product, Order etc</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.distributor.api</td><td>The service interface for operations which can be performed by distributors</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.jaxb</td><td>Support classes to help with JAXB marshalling and unmarshalling</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.orders.api</td><td>The low-level interface to the order management system</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.products.api</td><td>The interface to the product management system</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.test</td><td>Two marker interfaces (UnitTest and IntegrationTest) used with the @Category annotation to group JUnit tests</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.stock.api</td><td>The service interfaces which the StockService must implement, including messaging DTOs for communicating with Warehouses</td></tr>
<tr><td>gv.warehouse.api</td><td>The service interface which a warehouse must implement</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Design Approach</h2>
<p>
The way I designed the system was to use the requirements to drive a service-based architecture which embodies clear lines of responsibility.
This led to the gross <a href="./objectivesAndArchitecture.html#softwareArchitecture-diagram">software architecture diagram</a> you have already seen.
</p>

<p>
Once the overall shape of the system is laid-out, the next step is to define the interfaces which 
capture the interactions between the actors and the system.
</p>

<h3>Distributors</h3>
Recalling the requirements:
<div class="quotation">
	<p>
	Distributors must have access to a web interface which allows them to:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>List all products in the database together with their total stock levels.</li>
	<li>Place an order for a product and receive an acknowledgement.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

leads to the DistributorService interface:
<pre class="java">
public interface DistributorService {
	
	public List<Product> listProducts();
	public Product getProductById(Long productId);
	public int getTotalStock(Long productId);
	public OrderConfirmation placeOrder(Order order);
}
</pre>

and the POJOs which go with it. I have deliberately kept these simple, so e.g. the Product class looks like this:
<pre class="java">

public class Product {
	
	@XmlAttribute
	private Long id;
	
	@XmlAttribute
	private String name;
	
	@XmlElement
	private String description;
	
	...
	...
	...
</pre>

Which leads to an Order class which is just a list of OrderLines, each line specifying the quantity needed of a
productId:
<pre class="java">

@XmlRootElement()
public class Order {
	
	@XmlElementWrapper(name = "lines")
	@XmlElement(name="line", type = OrderLine.class)
	private List<OrderLine> lines;
	
	...
	...
	...
	
	public class OrderLine {
	
	@XmlAttribute
	private long productId;
	
	@XmlAttribute
	private int qty;
	
	...
	...
	...
</pre>

<p>
The OrderConfirmation is a bit more interesting since it contains some actual business logic to 
indicate whether it is confirming full shipment of all the items ordered, or only partial:
<pre class="java">

@XmlRootElement()
public class OrderConfirmation {
	
	@XmlElement
	private Order order;
	
	@XmlElementWrapper(name = "shipments")
	@XmlElement(name="shipment", type=Shipment.class)
	private List<Shipment> shipments;
	
	public OrderConfirmation() {}
	
	public OrderConfirmation(Order order, List<Shipment> shipments) {
		super();
		this.order = order;
		this.shipments = shipments;
	}

	public Order getOrder() {
		return order;
	}

	public List<Shipment> getShipments() {
		return shipments;
	}
	
	public boolean isPartial() {
		for(OrderLine line : order.getLines()) {
			int missing = line.getQty();
			for(Shipment s : shipments) {
				missing -= s.getQty(line.getProductId());
			}
			
			if(missing > 0) {
				return true;
			}
		}
		
		return false;
	}
}
</pre>
</p>

<h4>JAXB and SOAP</h4>
<p>
Note that JAXB annotations are present on all the POJOs which will be used for placing orders and receiving
confirmations, and there is an XSD present in resources/META-INF/schemas/gv.xsd 
which specifies the Order and OrderConfirmation document schemas. There are also unit tests checking
that Orders and OrderConfirmations are serialized as expected.
</p>

<p>
Now I have a confession to make. 
Spring recommends that if you are building a web-service you should write the contract first: you should
write the XSD and use it to generate the POJOs. Since I added the SOAP requirement after I had done a fair amount
of development, I decided to use my existing POJOs, annotate them and use the 
maven-jaxb-schemagen plugin to generate the XSD from the POJOs. The reason for this is that the POJOs generated
by going in the reverse direction are a little bit clunky.
</p>

<p>
What I should have done is to have the generated POJOs
placed in a different package such as gv.api.xml, and write mappers to transform them between the existing
POJOs. I chose not to to save time, but I wouldn't do it again.
</p>

<p>
What do I mean by 'clunky' generated POJOs? Well imagine an XSD which specifies that an order looks like:
<pre>
&lt;order&gt;
	&lt;lines&gt;
		&lt;line qty="2" productId="33" /&gt;
		&lt;line qty="4" productId="55"  /&gt;
	&lt;/lines&gt;
&lt;/order&gt;
</pre>

The generated code looks something like this:

<pre class="java">
class Order {
	
	private Lines lines;
	
	public Lines getLines() {
		return lines;
	}
	
	public class Lines {
		private List&lt;Line&gt; line;
		
		public List&lt;Line&gt; getLine() {
			return line;
		}
	}
}
</pre>

So that the code for looping over the lines looks weird because getLine() returns a list, not a Line!

<pre class="java">
Order order = getOrderFromSomewhere();

for(Line line : order.getLines().getLine()) {
	...
	...
}
</pre>

If anyone knows how to write the XSD or tweak the generator so that it produces more natural looking code, please let me know.
</p>

<h3>Administrators</h3>
<p>Recall the requirements for Administrators:</p>
<div class="quotation">
<p>
The Administrator must have access to a web interface which provides functionality to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Register warehouses with the system.</li>
<li>Create new products in the local database.</li>
<li>Set stock levels for products across all registered warehouses.</li>
<li>View pending stock alerts.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Bearing these in mind I sketched out the interfaces for the ProductService and the StockService.
</p>

<h2>Implementation - gv-core</h2>
<p>Once I had the overall architecture sketched out and defined the core interfaces I moved to 
implementation using a Test Driven Development methodology. So the first thing to do was to write 
a test for the DistributorService. You won't find that test in the project because once it 
became clear that the DistributorServiceImpl was merely proxying requests to the other services,
I refactored the tests into the tests for the individual services.
</p>

<p>
I'll let you read the tests and the code to see how I implemented the core services. The important
point for me was that I wrote absolutely no persistence code. Spring Data JPA took care of it all for me.
