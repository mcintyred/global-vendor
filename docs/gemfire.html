<h1>Global Vendor Gemfire Node</h1>
<h2>Using Spring Integration, Spring Data and Gemfire</h2>
<p>
In this post I am going to discuss using Spring Integration and Spring Data Gemfire to connect a variety of implementations of the WarehouseService
using Gemfire.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
There is nothing to install this time, since the Spring Data Gemfire support bundles the Gemfire components needed for testing. 
</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>
I have built the Gemfire examples to run in a Gemfire client/server configuration. Spring Integration
is used with RabbitMQ to connect the clients to the main (Host 1) server. There are two implementations:
<ul>
	<li>One uses a Gemfire CacheListener to generate stock alerts</li>
	<li>The other uses a Gemfire Continuous Query to generate stock alerts</li>
</ul>

Both use Spring Data Gemfire to use the Gemfire cache as a persistent repository.
</p>

<h3>Starting The Application</h3>
<p>
You can choose to run either the CacheListener or the ContinuousQuery clients, but not both at the same time.
Start the Server first: right-click on <code>gv-warehouse-gemfire/src/main/java/gv.warehouse.gemfire/Server</code>
and Run As/Java Application. Once the Server has started, do the same for whichever client you want to start.
</p>

<p>
The clients are configured (in <code>gv-gemfire-node.properties</code>) to have the warehouse name "tokyo", so in the admin
interface on Host1 you will need to add a new Remote Server called "tokyo". You can then add stock, place orders etc just
as you did <a href="remoteNode.html">previously</a>.
</p>

<h3>Code Discussion</h3>
<p>
There are three parts to the implementation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spring Integration configuration</li>
<li>The Spring Data Gemfire implementation of StockLevelRepository and the WarehouseServiceImpl which uses it</li>
<li>The StockAlertEventSource implementations using Gemfire CacheListener or ContinuousQuery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spring Integration Configuration</h4>
<p>
This part is easy. If you look at the configuration files under the <code>META-INF</code> directory, you will see that they
are almost identical to the ones in the gv-warehouse-node project. The differences are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>service-context.xml</code> defines a different implementation of WarehouseService - <code>gv.warehouse.gemfire.service.WarehouseServiceImpl</code></li>
<li>The WarehouseService uses a repository which is found by component-scan in the gemfire/client context files (<code>gv.warehouse.gemfire.service.repository.StockLevelRepository</code>)</li>
<li>The gemfire/client context files define the appropriate StockAlertEventSource to send StockAlerts to the stockAlertsGateway</li>
</ol>

<h4>Spring Data Gemfire</h4>
<p>
If you compare the implementations WarehouseServiceImpl in the gv-warehouse-gemfire and gv-warehouse-jpa projects
you will see that they are almost identical. The difference is that the gemfire implementation does not also
implement StockAlertEventSource. This is because in this project I wanted to take advantage of Gemfire's built-in
facilities for raising events: Cache Listeners and Continuous Queries.
</p>

<p>
The StockLevelRepository and StockLevelEntity in the Gemfire project are different to those in the JPA project.
In the JPA project the entity used a generated (<code>long</code>) value for its id, and the repository needed to have a method
defined to retrieve stock levels by warehouseName and productId:
</p>
<pre class="java">
public interface StockLevelRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;StockLevel, Long&gt; {
	
	public StockLevel findByWarehouseNameAndProductId(String warehouseName, Long productId);

}
</pre>

<p>
In the Gemfire project we must supply a unique key for entity ids, since a Gemfire cache is just a 

<code>Map&lt;K, v&gt;</code> to application code.

So there is an Id class:
</p>
<pre class="java">
@Region("stock_levels")
public class StockLevel implements Serializable {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

	@org.springframework.data.annotation.Id
	private final StockLevel.Id id;
	
	private final int qty;
	private final int oldQty;
	
	...
	...
	...
	
	public static class Id implements Serializable {
		
		private String warehouseName;
		
		private Long productId;
		...
		...
		}
}

</pre>
<p>
Notice how classes which are going to be stored by Gemfire must be serializable, and the equals() and hashCode()
methods are also implemented so Gemfire can compare objects properly.
</p>

<p>
Having the Id class using warehouseName and productId means that there is no need for a special finder
method on the repository, the WarehouseServiceImpl can just call the repository's <code>findOne()</code> method
which is supplied for us automatically when we extend CRUDRepository.

<pre class="java">
public interface StockLevelRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;StockLevel, StockLevel.Id&gt; {
	
}
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Generating StockAlerts Using Gemfire CacheListener</h4>
<p>
Gemfire is designed to run in a distributed manner, where multiple cache nodes can replicate all or part of other nodes' data.
When data changes in a cache, Gemfire send events to the other participating caches so that they can update their local
copies. Client applications can register to receive these events by implementing a Gemfire CacheListener.
</p>

<p>
The <code>StockChangeListener</code> class is an implementation of <code>CacheListenerAdapter</code> which uses the
<code>afterCreate(), afterDestroy(), afterUpdate() and afterInvalidate()</code> callbacks to generate <code>StockAlerts</code>.
</p>

<p>
The listener is registered with the cache in <code>gemfire/client/cl-cache-config.xml</code>, and the <code>stockAlertsGateway</code>
is injected into it. Spring Integration takes care of turning the <code>handleStockAlert()</code> call on the gateway into a message send
to the RabbitMQ stockAlertsExchange.
</p>

<pre class="xml">
		
	&lt;gfe-data:repositories base-package="gv.warehouse.gemfire"&gt;&lt;/gfe-data:repositories&gt;
	
	&lt;gfe:pool id="clientPool" subscription-enabled="true"&gt;
		&lt;gfe:server host="localhost" port="40404"/&gt;
	&lt;/gfe:pool&gt;
	
	&lt;gfe:client-cache id="clientCache" pool-name="clientPool" ready-for-events="true"/&gt;
	
	&lt;gfe:client-region id="stock_levels" key-constraint="gv.warehouse.gemfire.entity.StockLevel.Id" cache-ref="clientCache"&gt;
		&lt;gfe:cache-listener ref="stockListener" /&gt;
		&lt;gfe:regex-interest pattern=".*" receive-values="true" result-policy="KEYS_VALUES"/&gt;
	&lt;/gfe:client-region&gt;
	
	&lt;bean id="stockListener" class="gv.warehouse.gemfire.listener.StockChangeListener"&gt;
		&lt;property name="stockAlertListener" ref="stockAlertsGateway"/&gt;
		&lt;property name="stockAlertThreshold" value="10"/&gt;
	&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Notice the <code>&lt;gfe:regex-interest &gt;</code> element in the configuration. This is a way of telling the cache
which event types should be delivered to the listener, and helps to limit the number of events the listener has to handle.
Another way of restricting the events you have to process is to use a Gemfire <code>ContinuousQuery</code>.
</p>

<h4>Generating StockAlerts Using Gemfire ContinuousQueries</h4>
<p>
ContinuousQueries provide a way of monitoring the cache and only delivering events to a client when particular entities are affected.
They are configured by writing a simple Gemfire query such as
<pre>
SELECT * FROM /products WHERE sku = 'interesting'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The configuration file <code>gemfire/client/cq-cache-config.xml</code> configures a CQListener to receive
events for all updates to the /stock_levels region:
<pre class="xml">
...
...
	&lt;gfe:cq-listener-container id="cq-listener-container" cache="clientCache"&gt;
		&lt;gfe:listener ref="cqListener"
			query="select * from /stock_levels" /&gt;
	&lt;/gfe:cq-listener-container&gt;

	&lt;bean id="cqListener" class="gv.warehouse.gemfire.listener.CQListener"&gt;
		&lt;property name="stockAlertListener" ref="stockAlertsGateway"/&gt;
		&lt;property name="stockAlertThreshold" value="10"/&gt;
	&lt;/bean&gt;
...
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you look at the code for the CQListener you will see that whereas in the CacheListener we had access to the
previous value of a StockLevel, the CQListener only has access to the current value:
<pre class="java">
	public void handleEvent(CqEvent event) {
		
		if(event.getBaseOperation().isCreate()) {
			
			StockLevel level = (StockLevel) event.getNewValue();
			raiseStockAlert(level.getId(), 0, level.getQty());
			
		} else if(event.getBaseOperation().isUpdate()) {
			
			StockLevel level = (StockLevel) event.getNewValue();
			
			raiseStockAlert(level.getId(), level.getOldQty(), level.getQty());
			
		} else if(event.getBaseOperation().isDestroy()) {

			StockLevel level = (StockLevel) event.getNewValue();
			
			raiseStockAlert(level.getId(), level.getQty(), 0);
		}
	}
</pre>

Because of this I modified StockLevel, added the field <code>oldQty</code> and modified WarehouseServiceImpl
to update the field appropriately.
</p>

<p>
That's it for this post.
