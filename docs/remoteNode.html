	<h1>Global Vendor Gemfire Node</h1>
	<h2>Using Spring Integration, Spring Data and Gemfire</h2>
	<p>In this post I am going to discuss using Spring Integration and
		Spring Data Gemfire to connect a variety of implementations of the
		WarehouseService using Gemfire.</p>

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>There is nothing to install this time, since the Spring Data
		Gemfire support bundles the Gemfire components needed for testing.</p>

	<p>
		Once you have installed RabbitMQ, locate the file:

		<code>gv-warehouse-node/src/main/resources/gv-warehouse-node.properties</code>
		and update the gv.rabbit.* properties to connect to your RabbitMQ
		installation
	</p>

	<p>
		You can check that your installation is working by starting the
		gv-warehouse-node project. In your IDE navigate to the Main class (
		<code>gv-warehouse-node/src/main/java/gv/node/Main.java</code>
		) and run it as a Java Application (in Eclipse, right-click Run
		As/Java Application).
	</p>

	<p>Once it has started you should be able to see the queues and
		exchanges in your RabbitMQ console. By default this will be available
		on the server where you installed RabbitMQ at http://localhost:15672.
		You should see two exchanges:
	<ul>
		<li>stockAlertsExchange</li>
		<li>stockExchange</li>
	</ul>

	and there should be one queue: warehouse_london. Note that the name of
	the node is set in the properties file.
	</p>

	<p>Now start the gv-web project in the same way that you started
		gv-web-standalone in the previous post. This time, when the admin page
		comes up, you should be able to create new warehouses of type "Remote
		Warehouse":</p>

	<div class="screengrab">
		<div class="caption">Adding A Remote Warehouse</div>
		<img src="images/adminStartWithRemote.jpg" />
	</div>

	<p>Go ahead and create 'Paris' as a local warehouse and 'London' as
		a remote warehouse, and create products, make purchases etc exactly as
		you did previously. The RemoteWarehouse appears to the system as if it
		were local due to Spring Integration.</p>


	<h3>Spring Integration</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring
			Integration</a> project is an implementation of Enterprise Integration
		Patterns which provides a lightweight messaging framework. The key
		concept behind these patterns is that components of a distributed
		system communicate with each other by sending <strong>messages</strong>
		over <strong>channels</strong>. This pattern minimises coupling
		between components, and Spring's implementation means you can take
		advantage of it without your code having to be aware that it is
		running in a messaging environment.
	</p>

	<h4>Gateways</h4>
	<p>One of the key components in Spring Integration is the gateway.
		A gateway is an implementation of your interface provided by Spring
		Integration. That means that it can be injected into other components
		in your code and will respect the interface while hiding where and how
		the implementation actually works. The implementation Spring
		Integration provides you converts all method calls into messages sent
		onto channels, and messages received from reply channels are converted
		and returned as the method's return value.</p>

	<h4>Service Activator</h4>
	<p>A Service Activator is the counterpart to a Gateway. It turns
		messages into method calls on a Java component such as one of your
		service beans. Return values are converted back to messages and sent
		back along the reply channel.</p>

	<p>With that in mind, let's move on to the implementation of a
		remote warehouse.</p>

	<h3>Architecture</h3>
	The diagram below shows the architecture.

	<div class="diagram">
		<div class="caption">Remote JPA Node Architecture</div>
		<img src="images/remoteJPANode.jpg" />
	</div>

	<p>The implementation works as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Spring Integration provides a gateway which implements the
			WarehouseService interface</li>
		<li>We configure the gateway so that the messages it produces
			have a custom header <strong>GV_Method</strong>. This is set to the
			name of the method being called - <strong>setStock,
				updateStock, getStock etc</strong>.
		</li>
		<li>The request objects which are arguments to the method calls
			are serialized to a JSON format</li>
		<li>An additional header GV_Warehouse is added, set to the id of
			the warehouse.</li>
		<li>The message is sent to the RabbitMQ exchange named <strong>stockExchange</strong>,
			using the GV_Warehouse header as the routing key
		</li>
		<li>Rabbit routes the message to a queue with the same name as
			the routing key</li>
		<li>The warehouse node listening to the queue receives the
			message</li>
		<li>The GV_Method header is used to route the message onto the
			appropriate channel (one channel per method)</li>
		<li>The message is deserialized from JSON back into the
			appropriate request object</li>
		<li>A SpringIntegration <strong>Service Activator</strong> calls
			the appropriate method on the WarehouseServiceImpl, which queries the
			database using Spring Data JPA and returns a response
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If the method being called returns a value, Spring Integration
		will construct a reply channel and a temporary queue on RabbitMQ to
		receive it.</p>

	<h3>Configuration</h3>

	<p>Remember that the StockService calls the WarehouseServiceLocator
		to get the right WarehouseService to talk to a Warehouse. The
		WarehouseServiceLocator is initialised with a list of service in the
		application context:</p>
	<pre class="xml">
&lt;!-- Declare the list of WarehouseServices --&gt;
&lt;bean id="warehouseServiceList" class="gv.core.service.WarehouseServiceMap"&gt;
	&lt;constructor-arg&gt;
		&lt;map&gt;
			&lt;entry key="Local Database Service" value-ref="localWarehouseService"/&gt;		
		&lt;/map&gt;
	&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>
	<p>We are going to add to the list of services by getting Spring
		Integration to create a gateway for us which implements the
		WarehouseService interface:</p>
	<pre class="xml">
&lt;!-- Declare the list of WarehouseServices --&gt;
&lt;bean id="warehouseServiceList" class="gv.core.service.WarehouseServiceMap"&gt;
	&lt;constructor-arg&gt;
		&lt;map&gt;
			&lt;entry key="Local Database Service" value-ref="localWarehouseService"/&gt;		
			&lt;entry key="Remote Service" value-ref="outboundGateway"/&gt;		
		&lt;/map&gt;
	&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Now we need to implement the outbound gateway. This is done
		using the context files in
		gv-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/integration:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>rabbitmq-context.xml - Configures the connection to the
			RabbitMQ server and declares the exchanges</li>
		<li>amqp-context.xml - Configures the channel adapters which
			convert between Spring Integration internal messages and AMQP
			messages handled by RabbitMQ</li>
		<li>remote-warehouse-context.xml - Configures the
			WarehouseServiceGateway</li>
		<li>stock-alerts-context.xml - Configures a ServiceActivator to
			notify the StockService when stock alerts are received from remote
			systems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let's look at the remote-warehouse-context.xml file in a bit
		more detail. If you use STS then you can view the integration graph
		and you will see something like this:</p>

	<div class="diagram">
		<div class="caption">Remote Warehouse Context</div>
		<img src="images/remote-warehouse-context.jpg" />
	</div>

	<p>The top half of the diagram corresponds to the method call to
		the remote server, and the bottom half handles the return values.</p>

	<h4>Outbound Messages</h4>
	<p>Starting with the top of the integration graph, let's look at
		the actual XML so we can understand exactly what is happening. First,
		the configuration of the gateway itself:
	<pre class="xml">
&lt;int:gateway id="outboundGateway" service-interface="gv.warehouse.api.WarehouseService"
	default-request-channel="outbound-requests"
&gt;
	&lt;!-- Set the method header --&gt;
	&lt;int:method name="setStock"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="set-stock"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;
	
	&lt;int:method name="updateStock"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="update-stock"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;
	
	&lt;int:method name="getStock"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="get-stock"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;
	
	&lt;int:method name="requestShipment"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="request-shipment"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;
			
	&lt;int:method name="cancelShipment"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="cancel-shipment"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;
	
	&lt;int:method name="discontinueProduct"&gt;
		&lt;int:header name="GV_Method" value="discontinue-product"/&gt;
	&lt;/int:method&gt;

&lt;/int:gateway&gt;
</pre>

	<p>See how this matches the interface declaration:</p>
	<pre class="java">
public interface WarehouseService {

	int updateStock(StockChangeRequest request);
	int setStock(StockChangeRequest request);
	int getStock(StockQueryRequest request);
	void discontinueProduct(DiscontinueProductRequest request);
	ShipmentConfirmation requestShipment(ShipmentRequest request);
	void cancelShipment(Shipment shipment);
}
</pre>

	<p>For all the methods the GV_Method header is set and the message
		continues to the default request channel "outbound-requests", this is
		connected to a HeaderEnricher which adds the 'GV_WarehouseId' header:
	</p>

	<pre class="xml">
&lt;int:header-enricher input-channel="outbound-requests" output-channel="outbound-marshaller"&gt;
	&lt;int:header name="GV_WarehouseId" expression="'warehouse_' + payload.warehouseId"/&gt;
&lt;/int:header-enricher&gt;
</pre>

	<p>The next step is to convert the body of the message from a Java
		object to a string by serializing it to JSON. This is needed since
		AMQP is language-neutral, and we can't in general know what the
		implementation of message receivers will be:</p>

	<pre class="xml">
&lt;int:object-to-json-transformer input-channel="outbound-marshaller" output-channel="outbound-rabbit-requests"/&gt;
</pre>

	<p>From here the message is sent on to the
		"outbound-rabbit-requests" channel, where it goes through a gateway
		which converts it from a Spring Integration message to an AMQP message
		and sends it to RabbitMQ. Passing through RabbitMQ, it arrives on a
		warehouse queue, where it is picked up by a system running
		gv-warehouse-node.
	<h4>Inbound Messages On a Node</h4>
	<p>Let's take a look now at the configuration on a node, to see how
		the message is received, converted and used to call the appropriate
		method on the node's WarehouseService. Here's part of the
		configuration in
		gv-warehouse-node/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/integration/warehouse-service-context.xml:
	</p>
	<div class="screengrab">
		<div class="caption">Spring Integration Graph For A Node</div>
		<img src="images/jpaNodeFromCore.jpg" />
	</div>

	<p>The flow is actually pretty simple:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Messages arrive on the "inbound" channel</li>
		<li>A HeaderValue router forwards the message on based on the
			value of the GV_Method header</li>
		<li>Each method channel deserializes the message payload from
			JSON back to the appropriate Java object</li>
		<li>A ServiceActivator calls a method on the WarehouseService</li>
		<li>Any return value from the method is sent back along the reply
			channel which was set up anonymously. Scalar values such as <strong>ints</strong>
			are serialized automatically.
		</li>
		<li>The requestShipment() method returns an object (<strong>ShipmentConfirmation</strong>),
			so an object-to-json-transformer is used to serialize it to a string
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Let's go back to Host 1 now and see how the reply messages are
		handled.</p>

	<div class="screengrab">
		<div class="caption">Response Handling</div>
		<img src="images/coreFromJPANodeInboundResponses.jpg" />
	</div>

	<ul>
		<li>Messages arrive back on the "inbound-rabbit-responses"
			channel</li>
		<li>A HeaderValue router forwards the messages based on the value
			of the GV_Method header</li>
		<li>Responses to all methods other than "request-shipment" are
			forwarded on as-is, since they can be automatically deserialized back
			to Java (they are all Integer values)</li>
		<li>Responses to the "request-shipment" method are sent through a
			json-to-objet-transformer to deserialize them before begin sent on</li>
		<li>The messages finish at a ServiceActivator which just returns
			the value of the payload. This return value then is sent back
			automatically to the original gateway, where it is returned to the
			caller</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Here is the corresponding configuration:</p>

	<pre class="xml">
	&lt;int:header-value-router header-name="GV_Method" input-channel="inbound-rabbit-responses"&gt;
	&lt;int:mapping value="request-shipment" channel="request-shipment-ack"/&gt;	
	&lt;int:mapping value="set-stock" channel="inbound-responses"/&gt;	
	&lt;int:mapping value="get-stock" channel="inbound-responses"/&gt;	
	&lt;int:mapping value="update-stock" channel="inbound-responses"/&gt;	
&lt;/int:header-value-router&gt;	

&lt;int:json-to-object-transformer type="gv.stock.api.ShipmentConfirmation" 
	input-channel="request-shipment-ack" output-channel="inbound-responses"/&gt;

&lt;int:service-activator input-channel="inbound-responses" expression="payload"/&gt;
 </pre>
 
 <h3>Stock Alerts</h3>
 <p>
 The WarehouseService in the gv-warehouse-jpa project also implements the StockAlertEventSource interface. This means
 that it will send StockAlertEvents to any registered StockAlertListeners. In the core project, the listener is actually
 the StockService itself, but in a remote node the listener has been changed to use Spring Integration to send StockAlert
 messages using RabbitMQ:
 </p>
 
 <div class="screengrab">
 	<div class="caption">Stock Alerts Over RabbitMQ</div>
 	<img src="images/stockAlerts.jpg"/>
</div>

<p>
On the node, the configuration for this is in <code>gv-warehouse-node/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/integration/stock-alerts-context.xml</code>
which configures an outbound gateway as a StockAlertListener, and <code>gv-warehouse-node/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/services.xml</code> where
it is wired in to the WarehouseService. The integration graph is simple:
<div class="screengrab">
<div class="caption">Stock Alerts Node Integration Graph</div>
	<img src="images/jpaNodeToCoreStockAlerts.jpg"/>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Similarly the configuration to receive and process the alerts on the StockService is configured in
<code>gv-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/integration/stock-alerts-context.xml</code>
<div class="screengrab">
<div class="caption">Stock Alerts Integration Graph On Master</div>
	<img src="images/coreFromJPANodeStockAlert.jpg"/>
</div>

<p>Where the service activator is configured to call <code>handleStockAlert()</code> directly on the StockService:
<pre class="xml">
	&lt;int:channel id="inbound-stock-alerts"&gt;
 		&lt;int:interceptors&gt;
			&lt;int:wire-tap channel="logger" /&gt;
		&lt;/int:interceptors&gt;
	&lt;/int:channel&gt;
	&lt;int:logging-channel-adapter id="logger" level="DEBUG" /&gt;	
	
	
	&lt;int:json-to-object-transformer 
		input-channel="inbound-stock-alerts" 
		output-channel="stock-alerts" 
		type="gv.stock.api.StockAlert"
	/&gt;

	&lt;int:channel id="stock-alerts"/&gt;

	&lt;int:service-activator
		input-channel="stock-alerts"
		method="handleStockAlert"
		ref="stockServiceImpl"
	/&gt;
</pre>
</p>


	<p>That's all for this post. In the next post I'm going to talk
		about writing a WarehouseService implementation using GemFire.</p>
